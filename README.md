- 👋 Hi, I’m @Munstar0s I code and stuff or at least try to sometimes. this repo was created as a way to store and
     share some code if i feel like it and mostly organize other codes i usually use. 
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, programming, gaming and some other things i guess
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to be nice
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...discovering warp drives and making gaint donuts
- 📫 How to reach me : i live in a cave in the woods, find the man with the long beard and honey jar in hand.
